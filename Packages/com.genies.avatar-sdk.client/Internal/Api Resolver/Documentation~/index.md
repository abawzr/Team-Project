# Description

The marketplace is where users can see and purchase various assets for sale. 
This package contains code relevant to both internal and external users.

The Genies Marketplace is internal to party apps, but this external package is needed for code
that will also be exposed to external users of the Experience SDK, namely for the Experience
Marketplace, which will use some of the same API calls as Marketplace.
